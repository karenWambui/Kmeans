# Kmeans
This is a code for optimizing the number of K.
I started with understanding the data.
I performed the wrangling step. It had null values which I dropped.
I used StandardScaler for standardizing to ensure fair comparison and effective model training.
I performed K-Means, then used the elbow method to find the optimal clusters.
After analysis, the optimal clusters were 4.
